<h2>Remove virtual areas</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function removes virtual areas from an <code>antaresDataList</code> object and
corrects the data for the real areas. The <code>antaresDataList</code> object 
should contain area and link data to function correctly.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
removeVirtualAreas(x, storageFlexibility = NULL, production = NULL,
  reassignCosts = FALSE, newCols = TRUE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>antaresDataList</code> with at least components 
<code>areas</code> and <code>links</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>storageFlexibility</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing the names of the virtual 
storage/flexibility areas.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>production</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector containing the names of the virtual production 
areas.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>reassignCosts</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, the production costs of the virtual areas are 
reallocated to the real areas they are connected to. If the virtual areas 
are connected to a virtual hub, their costs are first reallocated to the 
hub and then the costs of the hub are reallocated to the real areas.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>newCols</code></td>
<td>
<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, new columns containing the production of the virtual
areas are added. If FALSE their production is added to the production of
the real areas they are connected to.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Two types of virtual areas have been defined corresponding to different types
of modeling in Antares and different types of post-treatment to do:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><p> Flexibility/storage areas are areas created to model 
pumping unit or any other flexibility that behave as a storage. For those 
virtual areas, the important results are flows on the links. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Production areas are areas created to isolate some generation from 
the &quot;real&quot; areas. They can be isolate for several reasons: to distinguish 
time-series (for example wind onshore/offshore), to select some specific 
unit to participate to day-ahead reserve, etc.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p><code>removeVirtualAreas</code> performs different corrections:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><p> Correct the balance of the real areas by removing the flows
to or from virtual areas.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If parameter <code>reassignCosts</code> is TRUE, then the costs of the 
virtual areas are reassigned to the real areas they are connected to. The
affected columns are <code>OV. COST</code>, <code>OP. COST</code>, <code>CO2 EMIS.</code>
and <code>NP COST</code>. If a virtual area is connected to a single real area,
all its costs are attributed to the real area. If it is connected to
several real areas, then costs at a given time step are divided between
them proportionally to the flows between them and the virtual area.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> For each storage/flexibility area, a column named like the area is 
created. It contains the values of the flow between the virtual area and 
the real areas. This column is interpreted as a production of
electricity: it is positive if the flow from the virtual area to the real
area is positive and negative otherwise. If parameter <code>newCols</code> is
<code>FALSE</code>, the values are added to the variable <code>PSP</code> and the 
columns is removed.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> If the parameter <code>production</code> is specified, then the non null
productions of the virtual areas are either added to the ones of the real 
areas they are connected to if <code>newCols = FALSE</code> or put in new 
columns if <code>newCols = TRUE</code>. In the second case the columns are 
named <code>*_virtual</code> where &quot;<code>*</code>&quot; is a type of 
production (wind, solar, nuclear, ...). Productions that are zero for
all virtual areas are omited.
If virtual production areas contains clusters then they will be move to the
real area. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Finally, virtual areas and the links connected to them are removed
from the data. 
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>The functions makes a few assumptions about the network. if they are
violated it will not act correctly: 
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><p> storage/flexibility
areas can be connected to other storage/flexibility areas (hubs), but at 
least one of them is connected to a real area. That means that there is
no group of virtual areas disconnected from the real network. If such a
group exists, you can either remove them manually or simply not import
them.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> production areas are connected to one and only one real area. They
cannot be connected to virtual areas. But a real area may by connected to
several production areas.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An <code>antaresDataList</code> object in which virtual areas have been removed and
data of the real has been corrected. See details for an explanation of the
corrections.

<pre>
## Not run: 

# Assume we have a network with two virtual areas acting as pump storage and
# an area representing offshore production
#
#  offshore
#     |
# real area - psp in
#           \
#             psp out
#

data &lt;- readAntares(areas="all", links="all")

# Remove pump storage virtual areas

correctedData &lt;- removeVirtualAreas(data, 
                                    storageFlexibility = c("psp in", "psp out"),
                                    production = "offshore")
